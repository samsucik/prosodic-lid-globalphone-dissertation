To what extent should I stick to the original topic?
- don't bother; particularly if you go further than the original topic

Related: How should I motivate the use of GlobalPhone rather than a different corpus? It was prescribed in the problem statement.
- just explain why GP is sensible, maybe discuss why it's too easy or hard compared with other corpora

2 of us working on the thing: How to write about it? How clearly to say what bits were created by whom?
- will check with Don; mention who's done what briefly. focus on own contributions.

Can I assume people read my references as well? For instance, when describing the X-vector DNN, shall I refer the reader to the paper, of repeat the architecture description?
- yes, people read references. BUT: include some explanation so that a reader can read the work for the first time and understand it all at a high level, without having to read references

Should I include extensive definitions of MFCCs, SDCs, of Kaldi pitch extractor? Or just a brief definition and a reference for a curious reader?
- mfcc = textbook stuff = keep very brief
- more specific (x-vector, pitch) = elaborate more
- explain in terms of contrast, comparison
- explain where relevant for the work

ideas
- list out key papers
- sketch plan for experiments
- imagine reader's done ASR
- aim for 40 pages of content
- maybe split Tamil on breaks intially
- further work: splitting long utterances intelligently (on pauses, phrase breaks, etc), not uniformly
