  Overview
    structure of the report

Background
  Definitions
    LID, identification vs verification
    acoustic (MFCC, SDC) vs prosodic (intonation, stress, rhythm) LID
    other definitions added later as needed

  Related work
    Standard approach -- GMMs and i-vectors
    State of the art -- x-vectors

Data
  Intro: Popular datasets
  GlobalPhone
  Data partitioning
    explanation of the use of training/enrollment/evaluation/testing data
  Data preprocessing
    SHN to WAV
    splitting long utterances into shorter ones

Implementation
  The Kaldi toolkit
  Adapted implementations
    Snyder et al.'s LID x-vector paper
    GlobalPhone recipe
    SRE16 recipe
  Description of x-vector+GP architecture (highlighting own contributions)
    how the whole pipeline works: go into much more detail than in the Related work section
    mention possibility of direct classification with TDNN and that I focus on using independent classifier because it provides extra flexibility
  Hyperparameters
    decided: TDNN layers, activation function, learning algorithm (TO-DO: understand shrinking), log-regression parameters
    empirically established: number of TDNN training epochs

Features used for language identification
  Intro: I will compare acoustic and prosodic features, leaving formants and BNF for later.
  Acoustic
    MFCCs (vanilla and with delta terms)
    SDCs
  Prosodic
    F0 (intonation), and KaldiPitch
    Energy (stress)
    Duration (rhythm)

Experiments
  Baseline
    vanilla MFCCs (expand on MFCC configuration)
    30s enrollment segments, 10s eval/test segments
  SDC vectors (wanna compare with MFCCs)
  KaldiPitch+Energy vectors
  MFCC/SDC + KaldiPitch+Energy vectors (concatenated), wanna see if they are complementary
  Possibly fusion of MFCC/SDC and KaldiPitch+Energy scores (using evaluation data for training the fusion logistic regression)
  Evaluation metric
    C_primary, also a score for every language separately

Results  
  Reported: overall C_primary, language-specific score
  Focus on Slavic languages (Czech, Croatian, Polish, Russian)
