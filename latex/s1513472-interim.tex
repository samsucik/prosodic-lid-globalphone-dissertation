  This is an example of {\tt infthesis} style.
  The file {\tt skeleton.tex} generates this document and can be 
  used to get a ``skeleton'' for your thesis.
  The abstract should summarise your report and fit in the space on the 
  first page.
  %
  You may, of course, use any other software to write your report,
  as long as you follow the same style. That means: producing a title
  page as given here, and including a table of contents and bibliography.

\chapter{Introduction}{

  The document structure should include:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
  The title page  in the format used above.
  \item
  An optional acknowledgements page.
  \item
  The table of contents.
  \item
  The report text divided into chapters as appropriate.
  \item
  The bibliography.
  \end{itemize}

  Commands for generating the title page appear in the skeleton file and
  are self explanatory.
  The file also includes commands to choose your report type (project
  report, thesis or dissertation) and degree.
  These will be placed in the appropriate place in the title page. 

  The default behaviour of the documentclass is to produce documents typeset in
  12 point.  Regardless of the formatting system you use, 
  it is recommended that you submit your thesis printed (or copied) 
  double sided.

  The report should be printed single-spaced.
  It should be 30 to 60 pages long, and preferably no shorter than 20 pages.
  Appendices are in addition to this and you should place detail
  here which may be too much or not strictly necessary when reading the relevant section.

  \section{Using Sections}{
    Divide your chapters into sub-parts as appropriate.
  }

  \section{Citations}{
    Note that citations 
    (like \cite{P1} or \cite{P2})
    can be generated using {\tt BibTeX} or by using the
    {\tt thebibliography} environment. This makes sure that the
    table of contents includes an entry for the bibliography.
    Of course you may use any other method as well.
  }

  \section{Options}{
    There are various documentclass options, see the documentation.  Here we are
    using an option ({\tt bsc} or {\tt minf}) to choose the degree type, plus:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item {\tt frontabs} (recommended) to put the abstract on the front page;
    \item {\tt twoside} (recommended) to format for two-sided printing, with
      each chapter starting on a right-hand page;
    \item {\tt singlespacing} (required) for single-spaced formating; and
    \item {\tt parskip} (a matter of taste) which alters the paragraph formatting so that
    paragraphs are separated by a vertical space, and there is no
    indentation at the start of each paragraph.
    \end{itemize}
  }

\chapter{The Real Thing}{
  Of course
  you may want to use several chapters and much more text than here.

\chapter{Prosody for LID}{
  \section{Features used in literature}{
    Various features used in the past in LID experiments:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item{Shifted delta cepstra (SDC) by \cite{Ferrer_et_al_2016} and \cite{Sarma_et_al_2018} (7D MFCC + 7-1-3-7 SDCs = 56D) and by \cite{Torres-Carrasquillo_et_al_2002} (10-1-3-3), }
    \item{19 MFCCs + energy + 20 $\Delta$ + 20 $\Delta\Delta$ = 60D by \cite{Sarma_et_al_2018} -- outperformed by SDCs, but note that they trained an ASR TDNN for generating i-vectors}
    \item{39D MFCC vectors combined with 4D pitch features \citep{Song_et_al_2013}}
    \item{39 PLP features (including $\Delta$ and $\Delta\Delta$) \citep{Lopez-Moreno_et_al_2014}}
    \item{\cite{Lin_et_al_2005} do LID just from the pitch contour parametrised by Legendre polynomials}
    \item{\cite{Ghahremani_et_al_2014} show ASR improvements with a pitch-tracking algorithm that calculates pitch even for unvoiced frames}
    \end{enumerate}
  }
  \section{Experiments with Prosodic Features}{
    MFCC fed into DNN
    SDC fed into DNN
    MFCC/SDC and KaldiPitch concatenatedfed and fed into X-vector DNN
    Two X-vector DNNs trained separately on MFCC/SDC and KaldiPitch
    - evaluated separately
    - the two X-vectors concatenated and classified and evaluated as a whole
