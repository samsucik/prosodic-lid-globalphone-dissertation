prosody discriminatory: brave statement?
segment boundaries: arbitrary and unnatural at the moment. strictly negative effect on performance? -> maybe in further work. unclear effect.
cite papers where things like TDNN, SGD+momentum or PLDA were introduced?
justify the choice of C-primary as the metric?
comment on what exactly things like article overlap or unbalanced dataset could mean?
mention specific script names to help the reader navigate the codebase?
how to go about VAD computed from C0?
can I simply name Paul when describing our collaboration?
familiarising myself with Kaldi and adapting the recipes took the most time after all (running experiments was much faster). shall I talk about this?
fusion: how much explanation about this? it's not too formal of a thing anyway...
ng-sgd: detail

Questions to send via e-mail:
- plan for y2: how much detail? Don on Piazza says it should be a detailed list of goals. can these also go outside LID? like, trying to apply prosody in speaker verification/identification
- authors at top of scripts: nice-to-have or must be? (preserving original authors as well as showing what was adapted/written by myself or Paul)
- I have experiments which is really short, then the results+discussion chapter, but I present some raw results
